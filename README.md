# hbm
Hierarchical block matrices (HBMs) are a powerful means for representing chromosome topology, 
which can be used to analyse high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (HiT-3C) data. 
This repository provides the implementation of three HBM-based algorithms: chromoHBM, chromoHBM-3D and chromoHBM-3C. 


chromoHBM: an iterative algorithm for computing HBMs from chromosomal contact maps in order to compress them into topological features. 
chromoHBM-3D: an algorithm for guiding the 3D reconstruction of chromosomal structures using HBM traversal. 
chromoHBM-3C: an algorithm for merging HBMs as a means for integrating HiT-3C contact maps.
